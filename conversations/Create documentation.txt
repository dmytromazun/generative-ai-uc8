I implemented an app according to these requirements:
Create user interface components for a form with the help of programming language, markup templating and add styling. Additionally, provide necessary event handlers to the created form's components to enable data collection from the user. Moreover, establish a connection with a centralized state manager solution to display the initial state and send collected data to the API 

Acceptance criteria 
React app is generated through CLI 
React app works locally, and the browser displays the home page. 
Production-ready package(build) can be created by running the build command. 
Removed comments and examples after generating the app from CLI 
The `first_name` and `last_name` fields should be validated on the presents of information 
The `email` field should be validated on the correctness of the email entered 
The `message` field should be validated on the length of the message (minimum 10 characters) 
State management code could be generated in a single file 
Success message could be displayed as a simple alert 
To verify that information was recorded and could be further sent, use console.log or alert. 

Now I need to update README.md with the description consisting of 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences.

Form Submission React App
This React application serves as an interactive user interface, allowing for efficient data collection through form components. Built with a blend of contemporary programming languages, templating markups, and styling enhancements, the app is designed with an emphasis on user experience and data accuracy. Event handlers are strategically placed on form components to ensure that users have immediate feedback on the information they provide. With the integration of a centralized state manager solution, data flows seamlessly between the interface and the backend, ensuring the initial state is effectively displayed and the collected data is accurately dispatched to the API.

To guarantee the robustness and quality of this application, certain acceptance criteria were diligently adhered to during its development. The React app has been generated through the CLI and functions flawlessly on local environments. It is also engineered for production-readiness, allowing for easy packaging through simple build commands. Form fields have been validated based on specific requirements ensuring data accuracy. Moreover, to ascertain that user data is correctly recorded and is ready to be dispatched, console logs and alerts have been implemented for immediate verification. Simple, efficient, and reliable - this app is crafted to meet the evolving demands of modern digital interactions.
